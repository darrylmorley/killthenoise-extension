# 🔐 KillTheNoise – Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** April 16, 2025

KillTheNoise is a browser extension designed to enhance your YouTube experience by filtering rage-bait, clickbait, and melodramatic content. We take your privacy seriously and are committed to ensuring your data remains private.

## 🔸 Data Collection

KillTheNoise **does not collect, store, or transmit** any personal data.

## 🔸 Data Usage

All data related to filtering preferences — such as your custom keyword list, toggle settings, and filter counters — is stored **locally** in your browser using Chrome’s extension storage. This information is never transmitted, shared, or synced to any server.

## 🔸 Permissions

KillTheNoise requires the following permissions:

- `storage` — used to save your preferences (e.g. keywords, toggle state)
- `host_permissions` (`https://www.youtube.com/*`) — required to scan YouTube pages for blocked content
- `scripting` — used to inject the content script that performs filtering

These permissions are used **only** for the functionality of the extension and not for tracking or analytics.

## 🔸 Third Parties

KillTheNoise does not communicate with any external services or third-party APIs. It runs entirely within your browser.

## 🔸 Updates

We may update this privacy policy if the extension’s functionality changes in a way that affects your data. Any updates will be posted here.
